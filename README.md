## Inspiration
Every year hundreds of thousands of preventable deaths occur due to the lack of first aid knowledge in our societies. Many lives could be saved if the right people are in the right places at the right times. We aim towards connecting people by giving them the opportunity to help each other in times of medical need.

## What it does
It is a mobile application that is aimed towards connecting members of our society together in times of urgent medical need. Users can sign up as respondents which will allow them to be notified when people within a 300 meter radius are having a medical emergency. This can help users receive first aid prior to the arrival of an ambulance or healthcare professional greatly increasing their chances of survival. This application fills the gap between making the 911 call and having the ambulance arrive.

## How we built it
The app is Android native and relies heavily on the Google Cloud Platform. User registration and authentication is done through the use of Fireauth. Additionally, user data, locations, help requests and responses are all communicated through the Firebase Realtime Database. Lastly, the Firebase ML Kit was also used to provide text recognition for the app's registration page. Users could take a picture of their ID and their information can be retracted.
